This release has one feature addition, in addition to doucmentation and support file updates.

Per @harikt, we have brought back the "finder" functionality from Aura.View v1. This means the TemplateRegistry can now search through directory paths to find templates implicitly, in addition to the existing explicitly registered templates. (Explicit mappings take precedence over search paths.)

Thanks also to @iansltx for his HHVM-related testing work.
